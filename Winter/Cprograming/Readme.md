## A Brief History to C
C language is one of the most famous programming languages and best known
middle-level languages.
Originally, it was designed for the development of the Unix operating system and
implemented in assembly language by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson in the
early stage of 1970s at AT&T. By design, it employs a static type system, procedural
paradigm and is to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory as well as
translated into machine instructions with minimal runtime support.
The versions of C were implemented for various machines during the 1970s and
1980s as its popularity grew significantly after its birth. In 1983, a committee formed
by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a standard
specification of C (often referred to ANSI C or C89 nowadays) and was ratified a few
years later in 1989.<br><br>
C has achieved great successes since its birth as it can be applicable to all contexts
in which low-level access is frequently or runtime efficiency is given top priority. Its
applications range from operating systems, embedded systems to website
programming. Some of its most famous applications are the Unix system, Windows
kernel and MySQL.
